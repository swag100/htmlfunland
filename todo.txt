goal: be able to remake 1-1

in Order to do that, we need to implement quite a lot of things

In progress:
    - Coins
    - Goombas
    - Container blocks being assigned items (might try to figure out object properties for this)

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- Object Properties
- Drag objects onto containerblocks to set their item
- Level Properties
- Level palettes (Figure out shaders)
- Sub worlds

- Add new objects
    - Coins
    - Cloud block (One way platform)
    - Pipe (drag pipe ends to extend length, click + drag pipe sides to extrude intersections)
    - Bridge (drag each side to extend)
    - Moving platform (drag each side to extend)
- Add enemies
    - Goomba
    - Koopa
    - Piranha Plant
    - Pipe paranha plant (drag piranha plant onto pipe)
